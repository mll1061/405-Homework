  <h1> Marissa-Biological Sciences </h1>

<p> I am taking this course because it is required of me. I thought it would be fun, but I'm not so sure anymore. </p>

<h2> The HTML Elements I Know </h2>
  Create a list (ordered or unordered) here with a structure similar to following:
  - Element Name
    - A clickable link to the MDN official document. Make sure this opens in a new browser tab
    - Display: Inline or Block
    - Attributes
      - Name of attribute : Description
      - List the rest of the attributes for this element (up to a max of 3)
  - List 5 more (for a total of six element names)

<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p>My experience in the first three weeks of class is probably that this stuff is overwhelming. It's hard as a student with no interest in HTML or coding or any of that stuff to follow along easily and devote my attention (no offense Jon!). I'm a dedicated student though and will push my way through. Luckily I sit next to a really smart guy who helps me a lot! (and most of his advice is to ask google... which seems obvious... but too obvious... sounds fake)</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure out how this will be of use to me in the Biology field, with my long-term goal of being a surgeon. But, it doesn't really matter because here I am! </p>
<p> Okay! Now enough of the negative! This class has also been a lot of fun! I think within stress, I laugh a lot because... what else is there to do?! I like how easygoing Jon is, and how we are allowed to use the internet for everything we do. I don't know if I could've memorized all this stuff.</p>
<p> I can't, but still kind of can, wait to see what the future weeks bring!</p>
